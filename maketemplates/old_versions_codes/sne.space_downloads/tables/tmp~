Analysis of the $NaI$ column density leads to a lower value of $E(B-V)_\mathrm{host} = 0.1-0.5$. Following  \citet{richmond94} used both values and we consider both in our analysis as well.}

\tablenotetext{3}{Different estimates are obtained with different techniques, and are summarized in Table 8 of \citet{richmond96}. The $\naew$ leads to to $\naew \sim 0.92$, consistent with the $Na$ column density measurements, although probably overestimated as discussed in \citet{richmond96, ho95}. Other values derived from spectra and light curve behavior are considered, and used by D11 and P16. As for SN~1003J, we consider both scenarios: the high extinction indicated by the $\naew$, and a lower extinction value found \citet{sauer06} from spectral fitting.}

\tablenotetext{4}{D11 and P16 uses $E(B-V)_\mathrm{host}$ = 0.26 and 0.28 respectively, both from \citet{stritzinger02}. This value is the estimated by \citet{benetti11} from the SED of the type Ia SN~1999ee, which also exploded in  IC 5179. We also consider the higher extinction value obtained from the $\naew$ measured in \citet{hamuy02} using the \citet{clocchiatti95} relation between $\naew$ and $E(B-V)$ (0.64).}


\tablenotetext{5}{\citet{prochaska04} suggets a possible identification of the host galaxy of SN~2003lw/GRB~031203 with HG 031203. The high line of sight extinction makes host galaxy identificatrion an characterization difficult.}

Updating the value of $E(B-V)_\mathrm{MW}$ to 0.904 as per \citet{schlafly11} we mantain the estimated value for the total extinction by setting  $E(B-V)_\mathrm{host} = 0.2$.}
