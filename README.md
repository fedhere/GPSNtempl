Stripped envelope supernovae (SESNe) are a family of supernovae for which progenitor and explosion channels are still poorly constrained. While their spectroscopic classification scheme is clear, photometric differences between classes also remain elusive. We know that they originate from massive stars that lost their envelopes of Hydrogen and Helium. A detailed mapping of each SESN subtype (IIb, Ib, Ic, Ib-BL)  to its stellar progenitor remain uncertain, as are the mechanism for envelope loss, and the relationships among subtypes and with long duration Gamma Ray Bursts (GRB) that are occasionally seen in conjunctions with Ic-BL.
Photometric surveys, like Vera C. Rubinâ€™s Legacy Survey of Space and Time, discovering tens of thousands of transients each night, offer an incredible opportunity to improve our knowledge of these supernova subtypes, but increasing emphasis has to be placed on photometric classification and characterization, as spectroscopic resources will only enable follow up of a small fraction of observed transients. We have generated data-driven photometric templates for SESNe subtypes using machine learning techniques (Gaussian processes) and a comprehensive  multi-survey dataset of all open-access data from the Open Supernova Catalog. We assess the photometric diversity of SESNe,
among and within subtypes, setting the stage for studies aimed at relating the explosion properties to their stellar progenitors.  Our templates can help evaluate the current photometric simulations used to develop classification methods and identify peculiar behavior.


This repository contains the codes, data, plots, tables and results of the paper "Data-driven Lightcurve templates for Stripped Envelope Supernovae" that was introduced above and is going to be submitted to the arxiv very soon!


This repo works with utilities which are stored in https://github.com/fedhere/SESNCfAlib and https://github.com/fedhere/fedsastroutils.
An older version of the repo also exists at https://github.com/fedhere/GPSNtempl.

First, set the following environmental variables (assuming bash syntax):

export SESNPATH = "path_to_main_directory/GP_templates_SES/"
export SESNCFAlib = "path_to_library/SESNCFAlib"
export UTILPATH = "path_to_randomutils/fedastroutils/"


The data is downloaded from the OSNC and is sotered in the "literature" folder in CfA SN data format:
